            <p>
                This is a project meant to showcase the analysis of the feedback gathered from customers when they purchase products off of a website. The system then analyses the feedback in the form of comments and states whether the comments are positive, neutral, or negative.

            <h4>Description</h4> <br />
            <p>
                This is a project meant to recreate the iconic Nokia snake game that we used to play as children, where a snake would eat a fruit and keep growing until it gets too big to fit into the screen and ends up either hitting the wall or biting its body. When that happens, the game ends and the player has to restart the game all over again.

            <h4>Description</h4> <br />
            <p>
                This is a project meant to showcase how even a NoSQL database can be manipulated by using SQL injection techniques such as a tautology. This was particularly interesting because for most of the time, it was considered that NoSQL databases couldn't be attacked by using traditional SQL injection methods.

            <p>
                This is a project meant to create a website plugin manager where a plugin can be managed by a user. That means toggling it to either an active or inactive state. The project also implements the toggle functionality of themes (dark and light mode) all the while not using any frameworks. It is plain JavaScript and DOM Manipulation.
